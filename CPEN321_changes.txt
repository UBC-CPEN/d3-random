We added a pareto distrubution random number generator

- Added file src/pareto.js which contains the actual implementation of the pareto
  generator function.
- Added file test/greaterThan.js which extends the test library 'Tape' which a new
  method - greaterThan. It tests if the 'actual' value is greater than the 'expected'
  value. It prints a descriptive message on failure.
- Added file test/pareto-test.js which contains unit test functions which test some
  properties of a sample of values generated by the pareto function we implemented.
